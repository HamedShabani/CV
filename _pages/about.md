I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Freiburg Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, where my research focuses on understanding the neural basis of cognitive flexibility in the prefrontal cortex. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Tuebingen, where I worked in the Retinal Prosthetics Lab, investigating neural coding in the retina during electrical stimulation. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering.

I am now aiming to transition into the fields of drug discovery and biotechnology, with a particular interest in gene editing and related technologies. I am passionate about both experimental and computational projects and am seeking opportunities in areas such as neural organoids and lab-on-a-chip systems, while remaining open to other innovative research directions. I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in these areas.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, swimming, and exploring nature through hiking.
